    <h2 class="section-title">Compassionate Allowances Program</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">The SSA’s Compassionate Allowances (CAL) program helps the agency quickly identify conditions that, by definition, meet standards for disability benefits.</p>
    <ul class="checklist">
      <li>Search the CAL conditions list to see if your diagnosis may qualify for an expedited decision.</li>
      <li>Submit comprehensive medical evidence with your application to reduce delays.</li>
      <li>Ask your oncology team to provide supporting documentation aligned to SSA criteria.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="note">
      <strong>Tip:</strong> If your CAL request is initially missed or denied, you may resubmit with clarifying records and physician letters.

    <h2 class="section-title">Insurance Guidance: Reminders</h2>
    <ol class="numbered">
      <li>Read your insurance policy before chemotherapy and try to determine what your plan will cover. Discuss costs with your oncologist—often there are several effective options that vary in costs and coverage.</li>
      <li>Open, review, and file bills and insurance notices immediately. If you have COBRA coverage, pay premiums in full and on time.</li>
      <li>Create a system for recording expenses and claims, filed under categories like “submitted” and “paid.”</li>
      <li>Pay by check or use a traceable method and attach confirmations to the related bill; keep everything together.</li>
      <li>Ask if your insurer assigned a case manager. Keep them informed about treatment. If your claim is denied, resubmit it. Make copies of all paperwork and record names, dates, and conversations.</li>
      <li>Request that your doctor, hospital, and/or treatment center provide peer‑reviewed studies to demonstrate treatment effectiveness to your insurer.</li>
      <li>Before treatment, contact your Medicaid office to check eligibility for reimbursements. Also ask pharmaceutical companies if reimbursement specialists are available. If confused, ask to speak to a nurse navigator, social worker, or financial advocate.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="section-intro">Hospitals typically have staff who can help resolve issues, locate interpreters, explain consent forms, and find help for co‑pays or costly drugs. Organizations such as CoPatient and the Patient Advocate Foundation also assist with denials and medical debt.</p>

  <!-- Appealing Insurance Denials -->
  <section id="appeals" class="section-card section-purple">
    <h2 class="section-title">Appealing Insurance Denials</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">It’s common for insurers to initially deny coverage for tests, procedures, or services. You can appeal decisions and may get them overturned.</p>
    <ul class="bullets">
      <li>Check whether your clinic has a staff member who can assist with the appeal.</li>
      <li>If the appeal is for medication coverage, some manufacturers may help with your appeal.</li>
      <li>When appealing yourself, be courteous and precise; document everything.</li>
      <li>If an internal appeal is denied, request a final written decision and file an external appeal. Private plans must offer external review processes.</li>
      <li>For additional help, contact your state Consumer Assistance Program, your state insurance department, or the U.S. Department of Labor (for ERISA plans).</li>
    </ul>
