    </div>
    <div class="section-body">
      <p>Survivorship care planning is a process that helps cancer survivors in transitioning from active treatment to post-treatment care. It involves the creation of a written or digital document that outlines the care a cancer survivor received and the plan for follow-up care.</p>
      <p>The plan is created by healthcare professionals, typically oncologists or nurse practitioners, in collaboration with the patient and serves as a roadmap for the survivor's health journey after active cancer treatment.</p>
      <p>This comprehensive document helps ensure coordination between the oncology team and primary care providers, addressing the unique health needs of cancer survivors as they navigate life after treatment.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Why Survivorship Care is Important</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="section-body">
      <p>Survivorship care planning plays a crucial role in ensuring coordinated care following cancer treatment. Research indicates that comprehensive survivorship care is essential for addressing the long-term effects of cancer and its treatment, monitoring for cancer recurrence, and improving overall quality of life.</p>
      <p>The Institute of Medicine recommends survivorship care plans for all cancer survivors to help patients transition from active treatment to post-treatment care. These plans provide a structured approach to managing ongoing physical and psychosocial effects, promoting regular follow-up care, and reducing unnecessary healthcare utilization.</p>
      <div class="info-box why-important-box">
        <p>With advancements in treatments, more people are surviving cancer than ever before. However, many survivors face challenges related to the aftereffects of treatment, emotional well-being, and navigating the healthcare system. A survivorship care plan addresses these issues in a comprehensive manner.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">What Information Do I Need to Create a Care Plan?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="section-body">
      <p>The OncoLife Survivorship Care Plan is a "survivorship care plan" that is individualized based on the answers you provide in a brief questionnaire. In order to develop the most accurate plan of care, you may need to talk to your oncology team to have some details of your cancer therapy available:</p>
      <ul class="info-list">
        <li>Type of cancer</li>
        <li>If you underwent surgery, what procedures were done?</li>
        <li>If you received chemotherapy, what medications were received?</li>
        <li>If you received radiation therapy, what type of cancer was this done for?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="section-title">What Should I Do with the Plan?</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="section-body">
      <p>This care plan is meant for you to review and discuss with your healthcare team (both oncology and primary care). Keep in mind that every case is different and the risks of some side effects vary based on the actual dose of radiation or chemotherapy that were received or the techniques that were used to administer these therapies.</p>
      <div class="important-note">
        <p>It is very important to review your plan of care with the oncology team to further clarify your risk.</p>
