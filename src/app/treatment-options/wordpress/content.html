                <p class="emphasis">The only way to cure a soft tissue sarcoma is to remove it with surgery, so surgery is part of the treatment for all soft tissue sarcomas whenever possible.</p>
                <p>It is important that your surgeon and other doctors are experienced in the treatment of sarcomas. These are difficult tumors to treat and require both experience and expertise. Studies have shown that patients with sarcomas have better outcomes when they are treated at specialized cancer centers that have experience in sarcoma treatment.</p>

                    <h4>Surgical Outcomes</h4>
                    <p>Surgery aims to remove the tumor along with a margin of normal tissue around it. The success of surgery depends on:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The size and location of the tumor</li>
                        <li>The grade of the tumor</li>
                        <li>Whether clean margins can be achieved</li>

                    <li>Wait & Watch approach with regular monitoring</li>
