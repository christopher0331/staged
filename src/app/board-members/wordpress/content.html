                <p>As the husband of a recently deceased ULMS patient, I can think of no better way to honor my wife than to support the work of NLMSF. After receiving a diagnosis with LMS, you are literally in for the fight of your life. Most of us do not have a medical background, but need to get up-to-speed quickly to make good choices for treatments that will increase chances for survival. That is where this group can help.</p>
                <p>Then, there is the emotional side to treatments. Side effects, reactions and appointments place an enormous amount of stress on the patient and caregiver. Reading the medical disclosure for treatments can be overwhelming. You need someone who hears your concerns and provides some first-hand experience.</p>
                <p>You will be told everyone is different. That is true, but you still need a sense for what lies ahead, what to look for and where to turn for help. I have joined the NLMSF to support their mission and purpose – i believe in their genuine efforts to help others through comprehensive websites, newsletters, patient programs and more.</p>

I have an assistant professor of Computer Science in the Jodrey School of Computer Science at Acadia University in Nova Scotia, Canada. I am now applying machine learning techniques to search for patient features (e.g., biomarkers) that help predict which treatments are best, to be applied on an individual level. My past research involved predicting who was most likely to give a charitable gift to a given organization. I worked with smaller data sets (which we often run into with LMS) but still produced accurate models. I'm hoping to produce similar LMS prediction models.</p>

                <p>"When my mother, Cynthia Solomon Holmes, was diagnosed on April 8, 2010 with Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) after visiting her doctor for a persistent cough, I was not prepared for how my world as I knew it would be turned upside down. Watching my mother fight this disease with the strength and vigor I knew to be her was an overwhelmingly painful experience. I felt physically helpless – but I knew how to pray. For her, my family and me. Following only a three-month battle with this dragon, my mother succumbed to the disease, passing away at the age of 52. I vowed to turn my personal tragedy into something that could be triumph for others who are faced with this disease through the creation of The Cynthia Solomon Holmes Foundation. I pray that through my efforts, individuals are inspired to support those battling this disease and in the daily fight for their right to live!" ~ Chandalyn Williams</p>
