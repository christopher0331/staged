            <h3>Initial Assessment</h3>
        </div>
        <p>When you visit your healthcare provider with a concerning lump or mass, they will perform a physical examination and review your medical history and symptoms. The diagnostic process typically includes:</p>
        <ul class="custom-bullet-list blue-bullet">
            <li>Physical examination to check for any visible or palpable abnormalities</li>
            <li>Review of your medical history and symptoms</li>
            <li>Various imaging tests to identify the location and extent of the tumor</li>
            <li>Biopsy to confirm the diagnosis</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are at least 100 different soft tissue neoplasms, including more than 80 benign tumors and over 50 soft tissue sarcomas – sometimes it is said 70 – 100 subtypes. In Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) itself, there can be as many as 14 LMS subtypes.</p>

            <h3>Biopsy</h3>
        </div>
        <p>A biopsy is necessary to confirm a diagnosis of Leiomyosarcoma. During this procedure:</p>
        <ul class="custom-bullet-list teal-bullet">
            <li>A sample of tissue is removed from the suspected tumor</li>
            <li>The sample is examined under a microscope by a pathologist</li>
            <li>Special tests may be performed on the tissue to determine the exact type of tumor</li>
            <li>Results help determine the grade and stage of the tumor</li>

                <h4>Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy</h4>

            <h3>Molecular Pathology</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
            Molecular pathology is a vital piece of the sarcoma puzzle. Identifying the presence of proteins in a tumor sample and genomic sequencing along with other molecular analysis to pinpoint a sarcoma's unique characteristics / gene characterization/sequencing is part of the pathology process.
        </p>
        <p>
            Genetic abnormalities that are known to drive sarcoma growth are also involved in molecular diagnostic tests.

            <h3>The Importance of an Accurate Pathology Report</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
            Soft tissue sarcomas are rare cancers with more than 100 different subgroups and tremendous morphologic heterogeneity. Based on the fact that pathologic diagnosis dictates prognosis and treatment, patients suffering from this orphan disease should receive a second opinion from a soft tissue pathologist before a final treatment decision is made.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Takeaway message:</strong> Patients should be mandatorily treated in specialized centers by a multidisciplinary team in close cooperation with physicians interested in this orphan disease.

        <p>
            Knowing what "drives" the tumor allows for pinpointing the best treatment approach.
            Staging the tumor - establishing its size, and possible spread based on the above, plus 
            "differentiation" of the cancer cells, and the mitotic rate, including possible evidence of tumor "necrosis" - all contribute to the grading of the tumor.

            <div class="term-box">
                <h5>Differentiation</h5>
                <p>In cancer, this describes how much or how little tumor tissue looks like the normal tissue it came from. Well-differentiated cancer cells look more like normal cells and tend to grow and spread more slowly than poorly differentiated or undifferentiated cancer cells.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="term-box">
                <h5>Mitotic Rate</h5>
                <p>Mitotic rate measures how fast melanoma cells are dividing and growing. It is a prognostic factor that can help predict outcomes and treatment options.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="term-box">
                <h5>Necrosis</h5>
                <p>Necrotic tumors are masses with dead tissue inside, caused by insufficient blood flow to the tumor cells. A form of cell death that can affect cancer treatment and prognosis.</p>

                The stages of soft tissue sarcomas range from stages I (1) through IV (4). As a rule, the lower the number, the less the cancer has spread. A higher number, such as stage IV, means cancer has spread more.
