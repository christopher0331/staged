                Blood Tests
            </h3>
            <p>Tests are not used to diagnose soft tissue sarcoma, but rather for signs of disease and assessment of your general health. Blood tests may be used to assess the response to drug treatment. Abnormal levels of certain chemicals in the blood can also be an assessment of the cancer having spread elsewhere in the body.</p>
            
            <div class="sub-category">
                <h4>Comprehensive Metabolic Panel</h4>
                <p>A comprehensive metabolic panel may involve testing up to 14 different chemicals in your blood. Deviations from normal levels can be indicative of cancer or other health concerns. This panel assesses chemicals originating from various organs, including the liver and bones.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>Surgery</h3>
                <p>This involves tumor resection, a surgical procedure to remove the tumor along with a wide margin of healthy tissue around it. This margin is extended beyond the tumor to minimize the chances of recurrence. Surgery, with an emphasis on achieving a broad margin, has historically proven to be the most effective and preferred method of treating leiomyosarcoma.</p>

                <p>Immunotherapy is an innovative treatment approach that harnesses certain aspects of the body's immune system to combat cancer. While it is on the horizon for leiomyosarcoma, further research and development are required to establish its efficacy in treating this particular type of cancer.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Research results suggest that ctDNA, assayed by a widely available sequencing approach, may be useful as a biomarker for a subset of patients with uterine and extrauterine LMS.</li>
                <li>Higher levels of ctDNA correlate with tumor size and disease progression.</li>
                <li>Liquid biopsies may assist in guiding treatment decisions, monitoring response to systemic therapy, surveying for disease recurrence, and differentiating benign and malignant smooth muscle tumors.</li>
                <li>LMS is frequently a clinically aggressive disease, and patients are at high risk for local and metastatic relapse after initial complete resection.</li>
