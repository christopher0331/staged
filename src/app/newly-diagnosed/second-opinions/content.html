          <p>From 17% to 68% of the patients, according to different authors Philip et al. (2010); Mellink et al. (2003), ask for second medical opinion to confirm diagnosis or treatment (Mellink et al., 2003). Nearly half (46%) of cancer patients sought a second medical opinion due to treatment complications (Tam et al., 2005).</p>

        <p>If you have a suspicious mass that could be sarcoma – regardless of body location – a sarcoma expert should see it first. Here's why:</p>

              <h4 id="centers-of-excellence">You might avoid surgery</h4>
              <p>Our advanced diagnostic techniques may determine whether your tumor is benign, in which case you may not need any surgery, not even for a biopsy.</p>
            </div>

          <div class="step">

            <div class="step-content">
              <h4>Some treatments should begin before tumor removal</h4>
              <p>Preoperative therapies like chemotherapy and radiation therapy are often used to prevent tumor cells from spreading and to improve surgeons' ability to remove it entirely, with clear margins. If your tumor is already removed before coming to a specialized center, your treatment choices may be limited.</p>

            <div class="step-content">
              <h4 id="rare-cancer-expertise">Sarcoma tumors are unique</h4>
              <p>Sarcoma tumors have a fragile outer capsule that contains the cancer cells into a mass. If the outer capsule is damaged during biopsy or an operation to remove it, cancer cells can "spill" from the tumor, allowing them to spread or regrow. In addition, microscopic cancer cells often infiltrate beyond what appears to be the edges of the tumor and these tumors often occur near critical blood vessels and organs. Sarcoma tumors should be biopsied and/or removed only by a highly skilled and experienced surgeon who specializes in this rare cancer.</p>

            <div class="step-content">
              <h4>Less-invasive biopsy</h4>
              <p>Core needle biopsy that's guided by imaging such as ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) reduces the risk for cancer cells to spill from the tumor. This helps reduce the chance that the tumor will recur or that a patient would need more drastic surgery, such as amputation. Image-guided core biopsy takes only minutes with little or no discomfort.</p>
