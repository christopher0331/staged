                    <p>Beatrice Sun, MD, is a 4th year general surgery resident at Stanford who will be pursuing a surgical oncology fellowship. During her residency, she spent two years of dedicated research time to study peritoneal surface malignancies, sarcoma, and the personal perspectives of cancer patients. This included a retrospective institutional study evaluating the utility of ctDNA to monitor treatment response and recurrent disease in sarcomas including leiomyosarcomas, which was presented at the annual Society for Surgical Oncology in March 2025. She is interested in translating this work into a prospective study that may have future implications in sarcoma surveillance and management.

                Doxorubicin-Induced Cardiotoxicity: A Comprehensive Update</p>
                
                <p><strong>Note:</strong><br>
                Abbreviation of this article by the NLMSF – for its highlights only. Share the complete article with your oncology care team / cardiologist:</p>
                
                <p>Doxorubicin is an effective anticancer agent that is widely used to treat breast cancer and other malignancies. Unfortunately, a common side effect of doxorubicin is cardiotoxicity, which can cause heart failure. The therapy carries a 3- to 5-fold greater risk for cardiotoxicity than other cancer drugs. According to the most recent statistics, up to 48% of patients receiving doxorubicin can develop heart failure.</p>
                
                <p>Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity is classified temporally into acute (occurring within a week of administration) and chronic (months to years post-treatment). Acute toxicity includes transient ECG abnormalities, arrhythmias, and pericarditis. Chronic toxicity manifests as progressive left-ventricular dysfunction, often culminating in symptomatic heart failure.</p>
                
                <p>Cardiac injury can occur as early as a single dose of doxorubicin or become evident as symptomatic heart failure months after doxorubicin treatment.</p>
                
                <p>Targeting these inflammatory pathways may represent a novel therapeutic avenue for mitigating the cardiotoxic effects of doxorubicin. Interventions aimed at blocking TLR signaling or inhibiting downstream inflammatory mediators can significantly reduce cardiac damage associated with doxorubicin treatment For instance, the modulation of TLR4 signaling through pharmacological agents has demonstrated promising cardioprotective effects by reducing inflammatory cytokine levels and preserving cardiac function.</p>
                
                <p>Overall, the recognition of inflammatory pathways as key players in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity highlights the need for further exploration of therapies targeting the innate immune response. Addressing the inflammatory component of cardiotoxicity could not only improve patient outcomes but also enhance the overall efficacy of doxorubicin in cancer treatment.</p>

                <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Program Guide – ASCO Meeting Program Guide</strong></p>
                
                <p>Lifetime cumulative doses of conventional doxorubicin (>450 mg/m2) are associated with dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. In soft tissue sarcoma (STS) and breast cancer, conventional doxorubicin is often utilized in earlier lines of therapy, whereas pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) is typically reserved for recurrent and metastatic disease. PLD is associated with less cardiotoxicity than conventional doxorubicin and high doses of PLD can be administered without increased risk of cardiotoxicity in patients without prior exposure to conventional doxorubicin. Limited data exists evaluating cardiotoxicity associated with PLD treatment after conventional doxorubicin, especially when doxorubicin lifetime doses approach the established cumulative total lifetime dose of 450-550 mg/m2</p>

                <p>Here are just a few signs that you may be magnesium deficient:<br>
                Anxiety / Depression / Muscle cramps / High Blood Pressure / Hormone Problems / Sleep Issues / Low Energy / Low Vitamin D / Low Vitamin K</p>
                
                <p>Magnesium helps manage insulin levels in the body and can prevent blood sugar spikes and crashes from occurring. It also plays a large role in blood pressure control, preventing high blood pressure from occurring, especially when combined with enough potassium in the diet. This does two things: controls stress that can elevate insulin levels and improves overall blood pressure that, when out of control, increases insulin resistance and can cause type 2 diabetes to occur more easily.
