                Many people have depression and anxiety during cancer treatment. You can get depression screening at no extra cost. Health plans sold on state Marketplaces, through the individual market, and through small employers must cover mental health services. While employers with more than 50 employees don't have to cover mental health services, most do.

                In addition, mental health services must be provided under the same terms and conditions as other health care services. Health plans can no longer provide more limited mental health benefits than they do for other health care benefits. How much you pay for your care will depend on the plan you enroll in.

                If you are on Medicare Part D, the Affordable Care Act is eliminating the so-called "donut hole." That's a gap in your prescription drug coverage. Prior to the Affordable Care Act, that made you pay the full cost of meds once you reached the annual drug-spending limit. Now, you pay only 25% of the costs of both covered brand name and generic drugs while in the donut hole.

                * Grandfathered health plans, those that existed before the Affordable Care Act was passed and have not significantly changed, are not required to offer some of these protections, such as bans on pre-existing conditions or annual limits on benefits. Check with your insurance company or HR department to find out if you're in a grandfathered plan. In addition, short-term health plans do not have to offer these benefits or protections. Short-term health policies are those in effect for less than 12 months, although they can be renewed for up to 3 years.
