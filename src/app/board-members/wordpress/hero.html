          Our Board members are here to serve patients, families, and caregivers. They are dedicated to addressing your questions and providing timely assistance when needed. Their primary focus remains advocating for and representing the LMS community's interests.

          Each Board member has a personal connection to LMS, whether through their own experience as a survivor or as a family member supporting a loved one through their journey with this rare cancer.
