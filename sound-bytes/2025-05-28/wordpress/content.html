                <p>Engineered cell therapies have demonstrated survival benefits for patients with certain hematologic cancers, but can they improve outcomes for patients with solid tumors? An Education Session will aim to answer this and other questions about how cell therapies are changing the treatment landscape for these patients.</p>
                
                <p>Engineered cell therapies are a form of immunotherapy derived by collecting a patient's immune cells (or, less frequently, a donor's cells), genetically engineering them to enhance the immune system's ability to attack tumor cells, and then infusing the engineered cells back into the patient. There has been progress for Synovial Sarcoma. . .great news!</p>
                
                <p>The National LMS Foundation will be probing for what next steps in research focus in this area might be for LMS at the upcoming ASCO meeting in Chicago starting May 30th.</p>

                <p><strong>Focus on One Thing at a Time</strong><br>
                Just contemplating, let alone actually dealing with, the reality of these potential psychosocial struggles can be completely overwhelming. Before you panic, know that there is no guarantee that you will have to deal with any of these issues. However, you should be prepared to handle those that do arise. As with any major task, prioritize what you need to deal with first; then focus on resolving that issue before moving on to the next.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Ask for Help</strong><br>
                Rather than trying to manage your difficult emotions and concerns on your own, ask for help. Some people are hesitant to ask for help because they don't want to be a burden. What many don't realize is that their friends and family are struggling with their own feelings of helplessness; they want to help you, but they may not know how. Asking for and accepting help benefits everyone.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Be Informed</strong><br>
                Seek out information on your disease, its treatment, and potential side effects, including psychosocial concerns. Talking with your healthcare team is a great place to start. Make a list of questions you want to ask, and write down the answers. When possible, take someone with you to act as a second set of ears and an extra brain to process all the information you're given. It's equally important to provide your healthcare team with detailed information about your condition and any side effects you've been experiencing to ensure that all your issues are addressed and you get the personalized treatment you need.</p>
