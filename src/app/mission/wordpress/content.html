                <div class="story-box">
                    <p>Harry and Diana were inspirations to the LMS ACOR online support group, and appreciated their guidance and help. From all this, the Foundation was born and incorporated in 2001.</p>
                    <p>Nancy Hoag made the signature purple and green ribbons, and her family helped with mailing information to patients, as well as helping her make the ribbons.</p>
                    <p>Karen Gibson coordinated the first Hugfest events, bringing patients and their families together to support one another in Pennsylvania. At the first Hugfest, Edmund Hoag spoke of creating a foundation to raise awareness and funding for Leiomyosarcoma research.</p>
                    <p>The Hugfest attendees were all enthused to support this initiative. The Foundation was formed by the support and commitment by the LMS Community. Edmund and Nancy proceeded to secure the needed funding and the first check for LMS research was given to the Research Community.</p>
                    <p>Karen Gibson (treasurer and secretary of the foundation) and Lynda Hendrix, an LMS patient, created the LMS Quilt to honor patients, and for a hopeful display at the Washington DC mall. Two quilts were created from mailed quilt squares received from across the country.</p>
