        <strong>Psychosocial Support for LMS Patients and Caregivers</strong><br>
        A cancer diagnosis affects not only physical health but also emotional, psychological, and social wellbeing. Both patients and caregivers may experience a range of psychosocial challenges throughout the cancer journey.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is normal to need extra help when dealing with cancer. Studies show that people with cancer who have social and resource support report better quality of life. However, many who could benefit from support services don't use them because they don't know about them or how to find them.

        This page provides information about common psychosocial challenges and the various types of support available to help patients and caregivers navigate these challenges.
