                <p>See Robin Jones MD discuss this research and other sarcoma presentations at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) <a href="https://ecancer.org/en/video" target="_blank" class="content-link">https://ecancer.org/en/video</a></p>
                
                <p>This phase 3 trial met the primary PFS endpoint and demonstrates superior PFS for Catequentinib vs placebo in metastatic/advanced LMS. This study confirms the acceptable benefit-risk profile of Catequentinib in LMS.</p>

                <h3>Before your Oncology Appointment (and ahead of each appointment):</h3>
                
                <p><strong>Do some research / Stay up to date on research progress.</strong> Since there are always new treatments - it helps to know what's out there. One good place to start is with the Foundation - we have done so much research on your behalf. Pick up the phone and call us: Our LMS LIFELINE HOTLINE operates 24/7 to be supportive and always there for you: 303-808-3437.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Create a medication / update your list.</strong> This should include both prescription and over-the-counter medications, as well as any supplements. Your doctor can review this and make sure nothing interferes with your current treatment plan. This information will be important when a treatment plan is established for you.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> You and your caregiver are always part of your oncology care team – so there is shared decision making in the treatment plan going forward/ treatment management and more.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Write down symptoms/ symptom changes</strong> that you are having as a result of your treatment. You'll want to let your sarcoma specialist know whether your symptoms have been getting better or worse. Also, share how the symptoms you are experiencing impact your life. Be as specific as possible: Keep a journal - Note the day and time symptoms occurred, how long they lasted, and how severe they were. Also note if there were any triggers linked to them, like stress.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Ask for Palliative Care</strong> if this has not been offered to you . . . . understand what palliative care is and is not so that you are fully aware of the support palliative care can have during your treatment journey.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Plan as much as you can in advance</strong> to be organized for every appointment. As one patient has expressed: "I always find that visits to my RRMS specialist wipe me out. I do as much as possible the night before: lay out my clothes, make my breakfast, and pack anything I might need."</p>
                
                <p>It helps to have a ride there and back, too. If you do not have a caregiver - a family member or a friend could help with transportation. It helps to have someone with you during the appt to take notes while you are speaking to your oncologist / the oncology care team members.</p>
                
                <p>Also, transport companies can hopefully be available in your area if you are in a wheel-chair. Additionally UBER AND LYFT offer free rides to cancer appointments: <a href="https://www.cancertherapyadvisor.com/home/cancer-topics/general-oncology/uber-lyft-rides-cancer-patients-medical-care/" target="_blank" class="content-link">Patients Are Relying on Lyft, Uber to Travel Far Distances to Medical Care - Cancer Therapy Advisor</a></p>
