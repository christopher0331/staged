        <strong>What are Clinical Trials?</strong><br>
        Clinical trials are research studies designed to evaluate new cutting-edge therapies using cancer patients. They provide an important opportunity for patients to be part of research efforts evaluating new chemotherapy and immunotherapy drugs/agents, new radiation therapy techniques, new surgical techniques, and creative new ways to use different cancer treatments in combination.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is most important to discuss with your oncologist the possibility of participating in a clinical trial, especially if you did not initially respond or are no longer responding to existing conventional therapies.
    </p>
    <p>
        This page provides essential information about clinical trials, their phases, how to find trials specific to Leiomyosarcoma, and important questions to ask when considering participation.
