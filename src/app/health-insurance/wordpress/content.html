            <p class="highlight-text"><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> A reminder of helpful information about Social Security Disability guidance</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-panel">
            <p>If you have been contributing to Social Security long enough and recently enough, if your disability makes it impossible for you to work, and if the disability looks like it will last for a year or longer, you can qualify for Social Security Disability. Your doctor will have to write a statement describing your disability for Social Security.</p>
            
            <div class="resource-list bulleted">
                <ul>
                    <li>No matter how young you are, SSDI pays full benefits – the full amount you would receive if you had reached full retirement age.</li>
                    <li>When you reach full retirement age, your benefits continue as normal Social Security retirement benefits.</li>
                    <li>If it's possible for you to work part-time, you can do that to supplement your income up to the limit Social Security sets. (The limit changes each year.)</li>
                    <li>There is a waiting period of five full months between your last day of work and your first monthly SSDI check. Ideally, your employer or your state will provide some kind of short-term disability payments during this time.</li>
                    <li>After you receive SSDI for 24 months, you will be eligible for Medicare regardless of your age.</li>
                    <li>Normally COBRA health insurance lasts only 18 months. Future SSDI recipients who ask promptly for an extension will receive it automatically – but you must ask. You'll need to have COBRA or find private health insurance to cover the 30-month waiting period for Medicare.</li>
                    <li>You can return to work any time you feel able to. Just let SSDI know. There is a trial period to make sure you can handle working again.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <p>If you have not worked long enough to qualify for SSDI, and if your assets are low, you might qualify for Supplemental Security Income instead. SSI provides immediate eligibility for Medicaid. You can return to work if you feel able; just let SSI know.</p>
            
            <p>The Social Security Administration has the official word. There are answers to just about any question a person has. It's actually pretty understandable, but it's very spread out over page after page of specific answers for specific situations.</p>

            <h3>Communicating with Your Health Insurance Company</h3>
            <p>If you have health insurance, it's important to learn about the specifics of your policy, including:</p>
            <div class="resource-list bulleted">
                <ul>
                    <li>What's covered</li>
                    <li>Deductibles (what you must pay out-of-pocket before your insurance company will begin to cover claims)</li>
                    <li>Co-payments or co-pays (a dollar amount set by your insurance provider required to be paid by a patient each time care or a drug is received)</li>
                    <li>Other out-of-pocket costs</li>
                    <li>How to best use your insurance benefits</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>A good place to start is with your health insurance card. Your insurance card will have numbers you can call to learn more about your policy. Many health insurance companies offer insurance case managers to assist insured individuals diagnosed with cancer. These trained individuals (often registered nurses or licensed social workers) will follow your case closely, helping to coordinate care and insurance benefits.</p>
            <p>Contact your insurance company to ask if they will assign you a case manager. Learning more about what your policy does and does not cover will help you better work with your insurer to make sure you receive all the benefits and coverage to which you are entitled. You will also be better prepared to deal with any questions or disputes you may encounter.</p>

                <p>Ask to speak to a nurse navigator, social worker or financial advocate. Every hospital has at least one of these pros available, and they can help you resolve a multitude of frustrating issues. You can also reach out to organizations that help with health care issues like insurance denials and medical debt. <a href="https://www.copatient.com/" target="_blank">CoPatient</a> and <a href="https://www.patientadvocate.org/" target="_blank">Patient Advocate Foundation</a> are two such organizations.</p>
