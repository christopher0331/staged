                <div class="appeal-body">
                    <p>Leiomyosarcoma is not just a rare cancer. It’s a devastating diagnosis that often comes with no warning — and no cure. Patients are told they have a disease most people have never heard of… and then they’re told they may only have five years to live, if that.</p>
                    <p>Imagine being told that — imagine it’s your spouse, your child, 9 there are 20 - 30 cases a year for kids)  your parent, your friend. And then imagine realizing that there’s almost no funding for research… that treatment options haven’t changed in decades… that hope is hard to find, not because it’s impossible, but because it's been neglected.</p>
                    <p>We can change that. But we need help.</p>
                    <p>Every donation — no matter how small — is a step toward hope. Toward longer lives. Toward better treatments. Toward one more birthday, one more hug, one more chance.</p>
                    <p><strong>Please, if you’re listening — give.</strong> Give because you can. Give because someone with Leiomyosarcoma can’t wait five more years for a cure that doesn’t come. Give so that one day, no one has to hear the words, ‘There’s nothing more we can do.’</p>
