                Since its inception in 2001, the National Leiomyosarcoma Foundation (NLMSF) has continued to provide important patient and caregiver resources, information assistance, advocacy, representation, and research support to advance and accelerate patient outcomes in diagnosis and treatment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ongoing annual funding for leiomyosarcoma (LMS) basic and translational research supports early-career investigators interested in sarcoma, especially leiomyosarcoma, as one of three larger patient-populated sarcoma subtypes. In addition to granting direct funding to research programs, the Foundation supports LMS-specific and sarcoma research through collaborations with other groups, ensuring that patient perspectives are included.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Foundation also coordinates virtual and on-site patient/family education programs to build awareness of the disease in communities globally.

                    The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has established various SPORE programs (Specialized Programs of Research Excellence) throughout the US in an effort to reduce cancer incidence and mortality and improve survival and quality of life for cancer patients. This SPORE at the University of Michigan is sponsored by the NLMSF, Rein in Sarcoma, and the Sarcoma Foundation of America. We have committed five years of funding support to this project, which focuses on understanding the genetics and genomics of leiomyosarcoma. As of 2022, the program has also included Career Enhancement Program and Developmental Research Program award support to early-career sarcoma research investigators from sarcoma centers of excellence across the USA.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dr. Mitch Achee continues to serve on the External Advisory Board of this SPORE, bringing the patient perspective to this program. Congratulations to Dr. Scott Schuetze and the team of researchers who continue to work together to better understand LMS with the goal of improving outcomes for those facing this disease. The National Leiomyosarcoma Foundation is proud and honored to provide financial support to this SPORE.

                    Since 2018 the NLMSF has been collaborating with the Broad Institute to develop verifiable LMS cell lines (that is, cell lines derived from patients' tumors, which can be used by researchers). A focus of this work is to recruit patients to send tissue samples to the project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2019, NLMSF made a funding commitment for three years for the Cell Line Dependency Map project to determine which drugs could be effective against LMS tumor cells.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2020, NLMSF made an additional funding grant for RNA sequencing of the 11 cell lines that have been developed so far to see if they represented the original tumor from which they were derived. (Cell lines that do not represent the original tumors have no value for research.) If validated, these cell lines will then be made available to researchers throughout the world to use in their LMS research.

                    <p>The NLMSF continues to encourage patients having surgery to donate fresh tumor tissue to the Boehm Lab at the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT through <a href="http://www.pattern.org" target="_blank" class="content-link">www.pattern.org</a>, an initiative of the Rare Cancer Research Foundation. Please sign up at least a week in advance of surgery in order to allow pattern.org to have time to coordinate with the medical center personnel.</p>

                            <strong>Research Project:</strong> Enhancing the adaptive immune response in LMS tumors through P13K/mTOR inhibition may render them more receptive to ICB, a downstream target of the P13K/mTOR pathway. This approach holds promise as a potential predictive biomarker for response. Investigate the immunomodulatory impacts of P13K/mTOR inhibitors on the Tumor Microenvironment (TME) and their capacity to overcome primary ICB resistance in LMS.
