                    <li><strong>Spiritual Support:</strong> Guidance from chaplains or pastoral counselors</li>

                <p>These services may be provided by psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, psychiatric clinical nurse specialists or nurse practitioners, licensed counselors, or pastoral counselors. They can help you deal with personal issues and refer you to other types of support if needed.</p>
                <p>Think about the kinds of problems you have, how much your emotions bother you, and how you have coped in the past. This will help you decide which services can best help you. You should also talk to your cancer care team about any psychosocial problems you are having, so they can help you find the right support.</p>

In counseling, you can talk with a trained professional about your worries and concerns. Having cancer or having a loved one with cancer is a different experience for each person.

                    <p>Couples or family counseling may be a healthy option as well. This may help a couple or family figure out what problems they are having by hearing from each other, and better understanding family member perspectives.</p>
                    <p>Learning why you or your family members act in certain ways are key to dealing with it. A counselor can offer guidance and assistance in family communication - to improve how they express feelings and help resolve conflicts. This can help the family come up with ideas about how they can better work and interact together. A win-win for everyone!</p>
