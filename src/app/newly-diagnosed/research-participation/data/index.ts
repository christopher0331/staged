  quote: "By contributing your tumor tissue through a surgery, biopsy, or fluid drain you make it possible for researchers to make a working copy of your cancer type that will continually grow in a laboratory. This copy is called a \"model\" and it makes it easy for researchers to study your cancer type and test treatment ideas. Simply put, by sharing your tumor tissue, you make it possible for researchers to make faster progress on critical cancer research.",
