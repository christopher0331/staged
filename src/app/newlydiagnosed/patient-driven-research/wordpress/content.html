            <p>The NLMSF in collaborative partnership with CURE ID, will be launching the Repurposed Drug initiative for Leiomyosarcoma patients to participate for a patient registry of de-identified data that will be analyzed against drugs approved by the FDA.

            <p>Drug repurposing refers to the identification of clinically approved drugs with the known safety profiles and defined pharmacokinetic properties for new indications. Despite the advances in oncology research, cancers are still associated with the most unmet medical needs.</p>
            
            <p>Tumor biomarkers associated with the different outcomes, such as the anticancer response or toxicity, can be used in the future, together with a patient's genetic profile, to personalize their treatment.</p>

            <p>In 2017, the Rare Cancer Research Foundation (RCRF) joined forces with the National Leiomyosarcoma Foundation. Through RCRF's patient-driven initiative, Pattern.org, leiomyosarcoma patients can contribute directly to groundbreaking LMS research. There is a transformative impact of tissue donation on rare sarcoma research and patients play a crucial role in this process.</p>
            
            <p>Participating is simple - just make the decision to provide your consent before your surgery through Pattern.org. By agreeing to donate your excess tumor tissue at Pattern.org before your scheduled surgery, you can significantly contribute to advancing research on Leiomyosarcoma (LMS). Your tumor tissue will be sent to MIT's Koch Institute, specifically the Boehm Lab, led by Dr. Jesse Boehm, the Principal Investigator. The lab's primary focus will be on genomics and cell line model development for leiomyosarcoma, and all research findings after de-identification will be made available to researchers globally.</p>

            <p>In early 2022, we will have a greater impact in our future through a project called Count Me In. This non-profit organization will collect samples and information from anyone who has ever had LMS in the United States and Canada—with appropriate privacy protections—and release the anonymous data publicly so that researchers can share their ideas on new, more effective ways to treat LMS.</p>
            
            <p class="emphasis-text">All you do is sign a consent and the rest is taken care of!</p>

            <ul class="research-benefits">
                <li>Ask LMS patients in the United States and Canada to submit samples of their tumors so they can undergo molecular and genomic research at the Broad Institute.</li>
                <li>Use this research to produce a large set of data that can be provided to researchers. Because LMS is so rare, this data will first help researchers to gain a better understanding of the disease—then expanded knowledge to work on better treatments.</li>
                <li>Provide you information about your individual data AT NO COST (available for patients who live in the United States, except New York; not available for Canadians).</li>

            <blockquote class="research-quote">
                <p>"We've been working closely with a committee of 10 LMS patients and caregivers to provide input and feedback on the project design. As the project launches and gets going, we will have more opportunities for members of the community to get involved with providing feedback and input on the project and we will share those as they're available. After we launch the project in early 2022, participants can provide questions or comments on their experience in the project through surveys and reaching out to the team."</p>

                <p>"If a participant elects during the consent process to share archive tissue samples with the project and the tumor sample is successfully sequenced, we can share information from the genomic sequencing of the tumor sample back with the participant.

        <div class="research-content">
            <p>As you may remember late last year the Broad Institute (a joint Harvard and MIT research institute) agreed to add Leiomyosarcoma patients to its Count Me In Project.</p>
            
            <p>The Goal of the Count Me In Project is to partner with patients with leiomyosarcoma around the United States and Canada in order to study their cancer using cutting-edge genomic and molecular research studies performed at the Broad Institute, and to leverage technology to allow patients to participate in these studies regardless of where they are treated.</p>
            
            <p>They will generate a large dataset that includes genomic, clinical, molecular, and patient-reported information that can be shared with the biomedical community in order to accelerate discoveries and better therapies for this disease. Cancer is not a single disease, and each medical record, tumor, and patient's story holds part of the puzzle. Our goal is to help the research community better understand the landscape of leiomyosarcoma and accelerate discoveries by making data more readily available.</p>
            
            <p>In addition, the Count Me In Team will study approaches to engaging with the LMS community and work directly with patients to improve our methods. We will focus on hearing from groups that have been historically left out of research, like rural and underrepresented participants. What we learn together will help improve future patient-partnered studies and increase the diversity of patients we partner with in an evidence-based way, to ensure that new insights are relevant to and benefit as many patients as possible.</p>
            
            <p>The LMS-specific COUNT ME IN project has just created a webpage <a href="https://joincountmein.org/lms" target="_blank" class="section-link">https://joincountmein.org/lms</a> with more details about the project which is going to start enrolling patients in early 2022. There is a button on the webpage where patients can sign-up to be notified when they can enroll in the project.</p>
            
            <p>This a great opportunity for all LMS patients to participate in a project that has great potential to help improve the understanding of our tumor and lead to more focused basic science and translational research with the goal of developing more targeted treatment options for LMS patients and hopefully improved survival.</p>
            
            <p>We encourage all LMS patients to take advantage of the opportunity to participate in this groundbreaking project.</p>

            <p>If you've ever been diagnosed with LMS, you can join the LMS project by sharing your samples, copies of your medical records, and your experiences. Information collected and shared will be de-identified before being shared widely with researchers to speed discoveries. All patient information is de-identified.</p>
            
            <h3 class="subsection-title">How Do You Participate?</h3>
            <p>You participate by giving the project permission to obtain your medical records, saliva, blood and stored tissue samples, and providing information about your personal LMS journey. <a href="https://joincountmein.org/lms" target="_blank" class="section-link">Click here to learn more...</a></p>

                <p>By consenting to share tumor tissue, ahead of a scheduled surgery, patients can make a real impact. De-identified tumor tissue will be sent to Dr. Jesse Boehm, head of this research initiative at the Koch Institute of MIT and Barbara Van Hare, Director of Patient Research and Advocacy Liaison, to help scientists develop next generation cancer models, which will be made widely available to the research community. Using these models, researchers can identify cancer's key points of vulnerability and accelerate drug development.</p>
