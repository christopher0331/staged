      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        The National Leiomyosarcoma Foundation (NLMSF) is dedicated to meeting the needs of leiomyosarcoma (LMS) patients, caregivers, and families through education and research. In order to facilitate advances in the treatment of LMS through research, the NLMSF is accepting research proposals for pilot studies that will launch "out of the box" ideas and new research trajectories to move the field forward.
      </p>
      <h3>Scope of the Award / Areas of Interest</h3>
      <p>
        All direct funds must be used to support LMS research. Proposals involving any scientific discipline are allowed including those related to biomarkers and imaging. This award was created to support basic and translational research. Other highly translational projects that are not based in a traditional wet lab may be considered (for example: in silico computational biology, radiomics, etc.); however, investigators who are considering submitting a non-traditional research project are highly encouraged to discuss the appropriateness of their project ahead of time. Clinical research (interventional trials) will not be supported by this award; however, work studying human samples and annotated data sets obtained from clinical trials is allowed. Studies requiring human samples must show documentation of IRB approval prior to awarding of funds (or document waivers if applicable).
      </p>
      <h3>Letter of Intent (LOI) Overview</h3>
      <p>
        The NLMSF seeks LOIs for research grant funding. The total award will be $50,000 per year for 2 years. Indirect costs should not exceed 10% of the total budget.
      </p>
      <p>The LOI should consist of:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Proposed research (2 page maximum)</li>
        <li>Applicant NIH Biosketch</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Key Dates</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>LOI due:</strong> April 15th, 2025</li>
        <li><strong>Invitations for full proposal sent:</strong> May 30th, 2025</li>
        <li><strong>Full proposal due:</strong> August 31st, 2025</li>
        <li><strong>Announcement:</strong> November 2025</li>
        <li><strong>Funding start date:</strong> January 2026</li>
