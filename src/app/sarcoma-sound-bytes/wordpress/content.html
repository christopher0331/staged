    <div class="info-box">
      <p>Immunotherapy is treatment that uses a person's own immune system to fight cancer. Immunotherapy can boost or change how the immune system works so it can find and attack cancer cells. If your treatment plan includes immunotherapy, knowing how it works and what to expect can often help you prepare for treatment and make informed decisions about your care.</p>

      <h3 class="faq-question">Is immunotherapy as hard on you as chemo?</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>The severity of side effects from immunotherapy and/or chemotherapy varies and is highly subjective. Chemotherapy often leads to immediate and noticeable side effects, as it affects all rapidly dividing cells. However, immunotherapy tends to cause immune-related side effects ranging from mild to severe. <span class="date">(Apr 6, 2025)</span></p>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-question">Can you combine targeted therapy with immunotherapy?</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Immunotherapy might consolidate the dramatic tumor responses achieved with targeted therapy into durable, long-lasting remissions, in which sustained host responses targeting multiple antigens may reduce the risk of potentially lethal drug-resistant clones. <span class="date">(Mar 27, 2014)</span></p>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3 class="faq-question">What is combination immunotherapy?</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Combination immunotherapy helps the body's immune cells (T cells) find and fight cancer. For some people, this could stop the cancer and shrink tumors. For others, the drugs may not work. Right now, there are thousands of clinical studies testing many combinations, for many cancers.</p>

      <h3 class="faq-question">What is the treatment of choice for leiomyosarcoma?</h3>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>The management of leiomyosarcoma depends on the disease site, tumor size, grade, and patient-dependent factors. The potential options include surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy. A multidisciplinary approach at high-volume sarcoma centers is highly recommended. <span class="date">(Feb 28, 2024)</span></p>
