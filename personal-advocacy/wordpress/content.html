Before you panic, know that there is no guarantee that you will have to deal with any of these issues. However, you should be prepared to handle those that do arise. As with any major task, prioritize what you need to deal with first; then focus on resolving that issue before moving on to the next.</p>

Some people are hesitant to ask for help because they don't want to be a burden. What many don't realize is that their friends and family are struggling with their own feelings of helplessness; they want to help you, but they may not know how. Asking for and accepting help benefits everyone.</p>

Make a list of questions you want to ask, and write down the answers. When possible, take someone with you to act as a second set of ears and an extra brain to process all the information you're given. It's equally important to provide your healthcare team with detailed information about your condition and any side effects you've been experiencing to ensure that all your issues are addressed and you get the personalized treatment you need.</p>
