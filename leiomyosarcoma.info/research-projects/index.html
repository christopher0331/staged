          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>The National Leiomyosarcoma Foundation (NLMSF) is dedicated to meeting the needs of leiomyosarcoma (LMS) patients through advocacy, education and research. In order to facilitate advances in the treatment of LMS through research, the NLMSF is accepting research proposals for pilot studies that will launch "out of the box" ideas and new research to improve the field forward.</p>
          
          <h3>Scope of the Award / Areas of Interest</h3>
          <p>All direct funds must be used to support LMS research. Proposals involving any scientific discipline are allowed including those related to biomarkers and imaging. This award was created to support basic and translational research. Other highly translational projects that are not based in a traditional wet lab may be considered for example, in silico research (computational biology, etc.); however, investigators who are considering submitting a non-traditional research project are highly encouraged to discuss the appropriateness of their project ahead of time. Clinical research (interventional trials) will not be supported by this award; however, work studying human samples and annotated data sets obtained from clinical trials is allowed. Studies requiring human samples must show documentation of IRB approval prior to awarding of funds (or document waivers if applicable).</p>
          
          <h3>Letter of Intent (LOI) Overview</h3>
          <p>The NLMSF seeks LOIs for research grant funding. The total award will be $50,000 over two years. Indirect costs should not exceed 8% of the total budget.</p>
          
          <p>The LOI should consist of:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Proposed research (2 page maximum)</li>
            <li>Applicant NIH Biosketch</li>
          </ol>
          
          <h3>Key Dates</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>LOI due: April 15th, 2025</li>
            <li>Invitations for full proposal sent: May 30th, 2025</li>
            <li>Full proposal due: August 31st, 2025</li>
            <li>Announcement: November 2025</li>
            <li>Funding start: January 2026</li>

            <p>"We are so grateful to the National Leiomyosarcoma Foundation for supporting out research! This support will allow us to develop and interrogate much needed laboratory models of leiomyosarcoma. For this first time, we will be using high-throughput drug screening approaches in patient samples and xenograft models to identify novel and targeted therapies, which we aim to translate into novel clinical trials and treatment options for patients. This urgently needed work wouldn't be possible without the support form NLMSF!</p>

            <p><span>Johns Hopkins Cancer Center</span></p>
            <p>The research project submitted by Dr. Llosa will take a deep dive into the microenvironment, the tumor biology and metabolism, and epigenetics, and its impact on LMS tumor cell biology – affecting immunotherapy progress. This is fine example of a project that holds great promise for the trajectory of LMS research focus for the future.</p>
            <p>This research project will focus on the following aims:<br>
            * Define the molecular mechanisms that regulate the accumulation and pathologic activation of TIM (Tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells) present in Human LMS.<br>
            * Decipher the phenotype and functional state of TIM responsible for T-cell suppression and enablement of immune evasion in human LMS.<br>
            * Determine whether metabolic inhibition of intra-tumoral myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and reprogramming of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) enhances antitumor immunity and tumor response to checkpoint blockage in a 3D human model of LMS.</p>
