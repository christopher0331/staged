        <h2>NLMSF Research Funding</h2>
        <p>
            Patients and their Families came together in 1997 to form the "HUGFEST" – a fore-running to what is now the National Leiomyosarcoma Foundation, incorporated in 2002. Since then, the NLMSF has been committed to funding innovative research projects focused on understanding and treating Leiomyosarcoma.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through the generous support of our donors and community, we have been able to fund numerous research projects over the years. Below is a comprehensive list of the projects we've supported, organized by year.

                <h5>Pre-Clinical Evaluation of Placental-Derived Natural Killer (NK) Cells to Target Leiomyosarcoma</h5>
                <p>The research project focuses on the hypothesis that placental-derived NK cells are more stem-like, leading to greater persistence in vivo compared to other sources of NK cells such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), thereby paving the way to improved and more durable anti-tumor effects in LMS patients.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>To demonstrate superior cytotoxicity of human placental-derived NK cell against human LMS cell lines and patient-derived primary tumors in vitro, including ADCC.</li>
                    <li>To demonstrate anti-tumor effects and imaging characteristics in vivo of placental-derived NK cells following adoptive transfer in murine models of LMS.</li>

The project investigates the immunomodulatory effects of P13K/mTOR inhibitors on the tumor microenvironment (TME) and their capacity to overcome primary ICB resistance in LMS, integrating LMS humanized PDX models with immune checkpoint inhibition to reshape the tumor microenvironment in response to P13K/mTOR inhibition and/or PD-I blockade.</p>

        <h3>Research Impact</h3>
        <p>
            The research funded by NLMSF has contributed significantly to our understanding of Leiomyosarcoma and has led to several important advances in diagnosis and treatment. Many of the projects we've supported have resulted in peer-reviewed publications, clinical trials, and new therapeutic approaches.
