      <p>“We are continuously updating this website to provide information on advances in Leiomyosarcoma research as well as the numerous collaborations that are occurring. The NLMSF has additional resources about Leiomyosarcoma on the NLMSF.org site. We are interested in your feedback as we continue to strive to improve sharing of Leiomyosarcoma information.”</p>

      <h3>Seth Pollack, MD — Director, Sarcoma Program, Lurie Cancer Center</h3>
      <p>“I love the NLMSF – I love the patient programs held – your signature support advocacy to collaborate with sarcoma centers. LMS is common enough to have had a specific focus initiative — and the NLMSF was many steps ahead of the curve to launch the LMS International Research Roundtable — to support patients in this way, and focus on LMS-specific research and support in the research landscape.”</p>

      <h3>Arun Singh, MD — Associate Professor, Sarcoma Service, UCLA</h3>
      <p>“The National Leiomyosarcoma Foundation is an important organization that strives to gather a critical mass of patients, scientists, patient advocates and physicians to learn more about this rare disease. Within the NLMSF, the LMS Research Roundtable organizes cutting-edge research and strives to innovate the ways that this disease is treated.”</p>

    <h3>University of Michigan to lead multi-site $12M grant to study rare sarcoma</h3>
    <p>“We recognized that to effectively study a rare cancer we had to assemble an outstanding international team from premier sarcoma centers,” said principal investigator Scott Schuetze, MD, PhD.</p>
