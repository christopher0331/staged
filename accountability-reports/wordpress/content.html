            <p>The National Leiomyosarcoma Foundation (NLMSF) was established in 2001. Our work consists of the following:</p>
            
            <ul class="foundation-work-list">
                <li>Funding LMS-specific research that advances the field of study and accelerates development of clinical trials and treatments.</li>
                <li>Supporting the LMS patient, family, and caregiver community through education, information sharing, resource assistance, and 24/7 direct phone support.</li>
                <li>Raising global, national, and community awareness of leiomyosarcoma.</li>
                <li>Addressing unmet needs in treatment, research, clinical trials, and care through the Foundation's International LMS Research Roundtable — collaborating with researchers, clinicians, partner organizations, and the LMS community to achieve meaningful progress.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We at the Foundation are most grateful to our donors, both in the United States and internationally, who have supported the Foundation's efforts to vet the most promising LMS research projects and fund them annually. The Executive Committee of the NLMSF conducts a comprehensive review of incoming research grant proposals in order to ensure that the donations are well placed in the selected research projects each year.</p>

            <p>Read on for a summary of our efforts over 2024 and our continuing programs and new initiatives for 2025.</p>

                <h3>Huntsman Cancer Institute Heredity Genomic Counseling Project</h3>
                <p>The National LMS Foundation has partnered with the Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah for a heredity genomic counseling project, a patient-driven data collection initiative launched in 2024: <a href="https://redcap01.brisc.utah.edu/ccts/redcap/surveys/?s=LNA4DNL9LE7C9ML7" target="_blank">Genetics Attitude Questionnaire / Cuestionario de actitud genética</a></p>
                
                <p>The NLMSF team and the Huntsman Cancer Institute genetic counselors are working together to understand what LMS patients think about the heritability of LMS and to explore their interest in genetic testing. The data collected and analyzed from this initiative will impact future NCCN (National Comprehensive Cancer Network) treatment guidelines, with such testing becoming incorporated into standard of care for the future.</p>

                    <p>This is an ad hoc program called on when patients or family members pose general questions (e.g., coping with side effects) to the NLMSF through our website or Facebook page. We refer such questions to one or more members of our Medical Advisory Panel, a group of clinical and research sarcoma and oncology experts (<a href="https://nlmsf.org/our-board/" target="_blank">https://nlmsf.org/our-board/</a>).</p>

                    <h4>LMS Research in Review</h4>
                    <p>Virtual discussions with experts are presented throughout the year via Zoom. Members of the global research community speak about their current research initiatives, clinical trials, and treatment updates in progress, with the opportunity for patients / caregivers to ask questions. These presentations are also recorded and made available for later viewing. Find current and past programs here: <a href="https://nlmsf.org/events/" target="_blank">https://nlmsf.org/events/</a></p>

                    <p>This discussion group meets on Zoom several times per year to discuss patient and caregiver experiences with clinical trials and suggestions on how trials could be improved. NLMSF board members in attendance serve on various committees with clinical trial working groups and can convey valuable suggestions generated in this group to clinicians planning / running clinical trials.</p>

Caregivers relatively new to LMS find it extremely helpful to hear from those who have been there before. (Includes podcasts and handout materials.)</p>

We talk about initial steps for newly diagnosed patients, finding a sarcoma center for treatment, questions to ask at appointments, how to talk to the oncology care team, and more. This group is useful to patients in all phases of diagnosis and treatment.</p>

                    <p>This occasional online discussion group covers the significance, objectives, and usefulness of having a survivorship care plan in place both during and after cancer treatment. A plan helps patients and their healthcare teams manage ongoing healthcare needs, address any potential long-term side effects, and ensure a smooth transition into post-treatment life.

It offers support in "picking up the pieces" and rebuilding lives, including with children.

Key features include evaluating the hypothesis that placental-derived NK cells expand more and live longer compared to peripheral blood NK cells, and that they also show sustained expression of CD16, a key marker allowing NK cells to kill tumor cells.</p>
