    <!-- Traits Cards Section -->
    <div class="nlmsf-traits-section">
      <!-- Trait 1: Compassion -->
      <div id="compassion" class="nlmsf-trait-card nlmsf-trait-compassion">
        <h4 class="nlmsf-trait-title">Compassion</h4>
        <p class="nlmsf-trait-description">
          Trying to understand what the loved one is experiencing and responding to that. Natural empathy and compassion – gentleness draws us together.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <!-- Trait 2: Patience -->
      <div id="patience" class="nlmsf-trait-card nlmsf-trait-patience">
        <h4 class="nlmsf-trait-title">Patience</h4>
        <p class="nlmsf-trait-description">
          "Patience is a virtue" – still remains true! Patience while caregiving enhances calmness to be able to help with treatment side effects and pain management.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <!-- Trait 3: Dependability/Reliability -->
      <div id="dependability" class="nlmsf-trait-card nlmsf-trait-dependability">
        <h4 class="nlmsf-trait-title">Dependability/Reliability</h4>
        <p class="nlmsf-trait-description">
          Our loved ones are depending on us to travel in the treatment journey with them as much as possible. Being dependable is a balancing act with trying to remain independent. Making a plan on how we will be there with our loved one is key to day-to-day, week-to-week routine so that we remain reliable and dependable to follow through caregiving commitment.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <!-- Trait 4: Flexibility -->
      <div id="flexibility" class="nlmsf-trait-card nlmsf-trait-flexibility">
        <h4 class="nlmsf-trait-title">Flexibility</h4>
        <p class="nlmsf-trait-description">
          Great routines established may from time to time require change. Here again, reliability and flexibility are a balance. Moods, care needs, abilities, and behaviors all play a part in the "routine." Empathy and patience come into play once again.
